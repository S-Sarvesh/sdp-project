HOTEL TAKEAWAY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Problem Description:
Traditional takeaway order management in hotels often relies on manual processes, leading to errors, delays, miscommunication between staff, and customer dissatisfaction. Tracking the status of orders, managing inventory, and coordinating between kitchen and front desk staff can become inefficient without a centralized system.

Motivation:
The increasing demand for takeaway services, especially post-pandemic, has made it essential for hotels to adapt more efficient digital solutions. A systemized approach not only improves operational efficiency but also enhances customer experience, reduces waiting time, and minimizes manual errors. Developing a digital management system empowers hotels to meet modern customer expectations for fast, accurate, and convenient service.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to design and develop a user-friendly, efficient Hotel Takeaway Management System that:
•	Streamlines order placement and tracking
•	Provides real-time status updates for orders
•	Facilitates role-based access for administrators and kitchen staff
•	Ensures efficient inventory and kitchen order management
•	Reduces human errors and enhances operational transparency

Client Description:
This system is intended for hotels, restaurants, and food service businesses that offer takeaway services. The clients may range from small independent hotels to large hotel chains looking to modernize their operations, enhance service quality, and improve customer satisfaction through a robust digital order management system.
